# R-codes-for-subtyping-MDD

The R codes for the following paper: 

Chenglong Yu, Mauricio Arcos-Burgos, Julio Licinio, Ma-Li Wong (2017). A latent genetic subtype of major depression identified by whole-exome genotyping data in a Mexican-American cohort, Translational Psychiatry, 7, e1134. 

Note: For the data file "MexSNP.csv", I just attached the first several columns since the complete one is too large to be attached, 
but the format is like that. After obtaining the distance matrix, you may use some other softwares such as MEGA or Matlab or R to build the cluster tree.
